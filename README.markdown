# My config files

I like my system this way.

## Installation

Clone this repo:

`git clone git://github.com/carlosgaldino/dungeon_files.git ~/.dungeon_files`

Then `cd` to the repo and run:

`rake install`

This will create symlinks for all files in this repo, like: `~/.bash_profile` to `~/.dungeon_files/bash_profile`
